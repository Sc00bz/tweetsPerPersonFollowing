# tweetsPerPersonFollowing()
Recently on Twitter, the people I'm following are tweeting a lot more and/or the few new people I'm following tweet a lot. Anyway I made this to see who's tweeting the most. So that I can unfollow them. This might be useful for others so here you go. Just copy and paste the code into the developer console and hit enter. Also if you don't know JS or didn't read the code, don't copy and paste code into the developer console. P.S. This will only report on the tweets that are loaded.

## "Features"
* Doesn't supress promoted tweets
* Only counts the first tweet in a conversation
